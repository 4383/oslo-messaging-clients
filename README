A simple RPC client and server, built around the oslo.messaging
library from Openstack.  An academic exercise simply to gain an
understanding of the oslo.messenger API!

For more info on Openstack and oslo.messaging, see:

  http://www.openstack.org/

Not officially part of the olso.messenger project, just my own sandbox
to play in.


TBD
---

o) eventlet testing (?)
o) resource-balancing a subscription across multiple Messenger threads
o) Lockup on failure of Messenger thread
o) Failover/reconnect routers

EXTERNAL ISSUES
---------------

dispatch: load balance across all servers servicing a given topic.
messenger: how to cancel subscriptions?
messenger: how to abort sent messages after a timeout?
messenger, qpidd: how to create queues/topics on demand?
